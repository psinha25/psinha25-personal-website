                    I discuss a project that involves Facebook's Graph API. I don't go into too much detail about the API, as it's quite difficult to understand and deserves it's own 
                    blog post to properly explain it. Maybe I'll make an instructional post in the near future about the API and provide some Python templates that can help you get 
                    started with it.

                <h3>WFAA Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm pretty sure all of you won't have heard of the <a href="https://www.advanceuw.org/" style="color:#0078ff">WFAA</a>. It's a pretty specific organization related to the University of 
                    Wisconsin - Madison. Basically, the WFAA is a nonprofit corporation that works closely with the university to encourage alumni and organizations to make gifts to UW 
                    (in other words, give money back to the university). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal of WFAA is to connect alumni with their alma mater and create a strong and close community of Badgers. WFAA hosts campaigns and events to bring alumni 
                    back to campus and foster Badger pride. The corporation has a large database of alumni and their history of interactions with UW-Madison after graduating (it's actually
                     really cool to see all the different Badgers that are spread over the world). They maintain a variety of different funds that are specific to different education sectors
                      at the university such that alumni can support areas that they feel truly passionate about.

                    The corporation has a variety of <a href="https://www.advanceuw.org/teams/" style="color:#0078ff">teams</a>. From Alumni Relations and Engagement to Development to IT 
                    to Operations and Administrations, each team has a specific goal with the overall intent to help the university thrive for years to come. I worked for the Information 
                    Technology team, where analytics, data science, and technology are used to come up with further advances. Specifically, I worked for the Data Analytics division (as 
                    opposed to the Data Warehouse team), which focused on using the abundance of data that is collected to help other teams with their work and make sound business decisions.

                <h3>Why WFAA?</h3>
                <p>
                    I should probably explain when, why, and how I worked at the WFAA. During my first internship at Optum (check out that blog post 
                    <a href="https://psinha25.github.io/psinha25-personal-website/optum-blog.html" style="color:#0078ff">here</a>), I went to a lot of tech talks 
                    specific to machine learning and hopped on the ML/AI bandwagon. I wanted to get experience in data science so that I could create machine learning models and sound 
                    super cool. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I reached out to professors at Madison doing research in machine learning hoping they would give me an opportunity to help them with their work. Little did I know 
                    that statistics and linear algebra were foundational pieces of machine learning, and the last stats course I took was AP Stats in 9th grade (5 years prior). 
                    Clearly I wasn't qualified. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I figured I might as well try to find a job on campus (preferably involving data science) and make some money. I used the 
                    <a href="https://studentjobs.wisc.edu/" style="color:#0078ff">students jobs portal</a> (which is actually super helpful, if any Badgers are looking for 
                    campus jobs I would seriously check out the portal) and applied to the WFAA. After receiving a call to do an interview and "passing" the interview somehow 
                    (honestly not sure how I did, because I really didn't have much experience in the field and spoke out of my ass), I got the position to be a Data Science 
                    Intern indefinitely (there really wasn't an end to my time). I ended up working there for the entirety of my sophomore year, which was a huge blessing because 
                    I helped my parents pay for college housing and meals. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Projects</h3>
                <p>My time at WFAA was broken down into the two semesters of sophomore year.</p>
                <h4>Semester 1</h4>
                <p>
                    When I first joined the company mid-September 2019, I had minimal SQL experience. I knew the purpose of it (to interact with databases) but that's about it. 
                    So the entirety of my first semester, I focused on learning SQL. My manager gave me a list SQL exercises that he had created for previous interns that taught 
                    a lot of the core concepts of SQL. More importantly, I got to use the WFAA database, which has oodles of data. This was especially important, as I realized that 
                    domain and business intelligence is even more valuable that technical expertise in the field of data science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To my surprise, I really struggled with SQL. Even after that entire semester, I never fully grasped SQL. It isn't a normal programming language that I was 
                    accustomed to. Even worse, I learned that the SQL that I write isn't necessarily a direct translation to how data is collected from the database. The DBMS 
                    (database management system) has a plethora of data structures and algorithms that it uses to efficiently query data from a database. Given my nature to want 
                    to understand how things work, I found it hard to accept that I don't need to know what's happening under the hood in order to use SQL and databases. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, by the end of the semester I was definitely more fluent with SQL - at least to a point where I could begin actual projects and figure things
                    out. Below is an image of the complexity of SQL queries I learned that semester. 
                </p>

                  <figcaption>SQL Query Example</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>Semester 2</h4>
                <p>
                    When the spring semester of my sophomore year began, I had a better grasp of SQL, but more importantly a better grasp of the work that WFAA does, the 
                    data in our DBMS, and overall domain knowledge. I finally got to work on some actual projects! Machine learning, here we come!!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unsurprisingly, my two projects didn't involve machine learning whatsoever. Turns out there is more to data science than machine learning üòÇ. In all seriousness, 
                    data science is such a broad field and machine learning is one subset of it. Often times young engineers are just interested in making machine learning models 
                    (I was guilty of this), but having foundational understanding of data, data collection and cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistics is so important. 
                </p>
                <p>Luckily, I was put in place and my two projects involved exploratory analysis and data collection, respectively. </p>
                <h6>Project 1</h6>
                <p>
                    My first project involved determining whether there is any correlation, pattern, or simply a difference in gift giving based on gender. This project was on the team's 
                    backlog for a while, but they never worked on it because it was a sensitive and onerous task. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we had to consider how to account for individuals that weren't cisgender (individuals that are cisgender are people whose gender identity and biological sex 
                    assigned at birth are the same, i.e. biologically born females express their gender as females). While we accepted that gender isn't binary, the majority of donors 
                    (over 98%) fell into the male or female category. As such, we decided it was best to categorize people based on being "male", "female", or "other genders". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we felt it's inaccurate to compare the amount of giving from an alumni that graduated in 1955 to a 2010 alumn, as the latter person had less time 
                    (and most likely less money given their age) to give. To account for this, we grouped donors based based on their graduation year into a 5 year window. In other 
                    words, alumni from 1955-1959 were compared together, and alumni from 2010-2014 were compare together. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, there was the need to handle two-person households. At the WFAA, if a donor was part of a two-person household and gave some contribution to UW, their partner 
                    would also be considered a donor in that given transaction. Given that we couldn't determine which partner "wanted" to give to UW, it was impossible to correlate a 
                    gift from a two-person household to a specific gender. As such, we had to create a group of giving for two-person households. 
                </p>
                <p>To summarize, the breakdown of independent variables was as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Alumni that graduated within the same 5 year bucket (that we arbitrarily created) were compared against one other.</li>
                  <li>The different categories were single male, single female, two-person household, and other single genders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After determining how to group donors, data needed to be aggregated from the SQL database in an easy format that could be imported into Tableau for analysis. 
                    Given how large the database of information on donors, gifts, etc. was, this process took a while. This was my first exposure to the reality that data scientists 
                    spend a significant portion of their time aggregating and cleansing data. 
                </p>
                <p>My SQL code ended up being a couple files large and a plethora of advanced SQL operators and functions were used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>window functions</li>
                    <li>views</li>
                    <li>aggregation operatores</li>
                    <li>nested queries</li>
                    <li>correlated queries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After the data aggregation and data cleansing step, I finally got to create beautiful, colorful graphs in Tableau! This piece of the project was enjoyable and 
                    intriguing. Not only did I learn how to use Tableau, but also realized the importance being curious and allowing myself to dive deeper and deeper into the data. 
                    I wasn't given any suggestions on the types of graphs to make or what categories to focus on. I quickly realized that being open-minded, unsatisfied, and curious 
                    were three traits that led to meaningful findings. In addition, consistently asking myself "if I was reading a report about whether there was a correlation, a pattern, 
                    a difference, anything, between gender and the amount of giving, what would I want to see visually to be able to quickly understand what the author of the report is 
                    trying to convey?". 
                </p>
                <figure class="blog-image">
                  <img src="assets/img/tableau.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                  <figcaption>Tableau Dashboard Example</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The final step to the project was to write out a succinct report and presentation. This is another job of data scientist that is often overlooked. Writing succinct and 
                    insightful reports is difficult, especially if data collection, data cleansing, and data analysis were done without thinking about the end product (which is the actual 
                    findings of the study).

                <p>
                    The second project I worked on wasn't a typical data science project but rather a software engineering project. My team wanted to collect publicly available data from 
                    Facebook of our donors. With an understanding that this could be possible using the Facebook API, I was in charge of actually trying to make this come to fruition. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me tell you right now, the Facebook API is a behemoth. If you're learning it for the first time, be prepared to spend at least 5-10 hours just reading through 
                    their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/" style="color:#0078ff">API documentation</a>. I remember reading through the beginning pages of 
                    documentation and literally asking myself "what did I just read?". It's really dense and has a lot of functionality, so you have to sift through the documentation 
                    to find what you're looking for. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why is it called a Graph API? Well, think of Facebook as one large graph (as in the data structure, not a line or bar graph). The foundational pieces of the graph 
                    data structure are nodes and edges. Think of the node as actual data (i.e. a Facebook user/profile) and the edges as relationships between nodes. If you and I are 
                    Facebook users, we will each have our own profile, or node, and if we are friends on Facebook, there would be an edge between us because we have a relationship. 
                    That's essentially all there is to it. Facebook is one large graph of users, posts, reactions, comments, etc. Everything is connected together, hence the name Graph API. 
                </p>

                  <figcaption>Facebook Graph Data Structure</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    After developing an initial understanding of how the Graph API works, I attempted to get started on the Python program. Facebook provides a 
                    <a href="https://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html" style="color:#0078ff">Python SDK</a> (Software Development Kit), which is a fancy way of saying Python functions that you 
                    can import, to make API calls and retrieve information from Facebook servers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was in the beginning steps when attempting to
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get an access token for my application</li>
                    <li>Register my application with Facebook</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Based on the documentation of the Graph API, Facebook has an underlying assumption that users of their API are developing physical apps (that go onto the app store) 
                    and using Facebook as an authentication platform into the application. However, our program wasn't a physical application but rather code to collect data. This made 
                    it particularly challenging to understand how my program could make API calls. Eventually, I figured out a work around and was able to move forward. I had to use 
                    the Facebook Developers interface in order to register my application and receive access tokens. It was actually a really helpful tool because I could basically 
                    test my application and make API calls directly from it.

                    Unfortunately, I had to leave WFAA towards the end of this project and didn't get to see it through (because I was starting my next internship at Medtronic during the 
                    Summer 2020). That being said, I made sure to create documentation on the Graph API and provide concrete next steps such that other developers on the team could take 
                    it over and wrap up the data collection. 
                </p>
                <h3>Internship Reflection</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>
                    Taking on an internship on top of school was quite a challenge for me. The biggest lesson I learned was how to balance my time. I've always found it hard to prioritize 
                    anything over school, but I owed WFAA my time and effort given that I was getting payed. As such, I had to mentally allow myself to prioritize my time at WFAA 
                    even if I had big projects or exams coming up for school. I ended up meeting all my academic goals (in terms of the grades I want to get) while working 15-20 hours a 
                    week at WFAA and developed a confidence in myself that I can juggle multiple things at once. 
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    The two big projects I undertook second semester gave me an opportunity to improve my skills in a couple of very useful technologies: SQL, Python, and Tableau. Not much 
                    more to say here other than the fact that projects are the best way to improve technical skills.  
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Obviously, I learned quite a bit about data science given that I was a data science intern...</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                        Domain knowledge is just as important, if not more, than technical skills. The amount of time it took me to validate SQL scripts I wrote for data aggregation 
                        would've decreased significantly if I had prior domain knowledge in philanthropy and alumni-university relations. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is more to data science than machine learning. Exploratory analysis, statistics, business expertise, etc. are all big parts of data science and equally 
                        important. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data cleansing and aggregation is arduous but extremely important. If done correctly, later steps in the project, such as actual analysis, can be much simpler and 
                        efficient. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using data to tell a story is an art. Data itself can be pretty boring if you're not a data nerd (like me). To capture the attention of an audience with data 
                        can be tricky if not set up correctly. Thankfully, I got a couple opportunities to present my findings to my team and hone my presentation skills. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Curiosity is how to start any data science project. Being open-minded and curious with the data is the best way to get direction and create structure towards 
                        completing it. There is no limit on how to deep to go with analysis. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    After a year of working as a data science intern, I've become ambivalent to data science and machine learning for that matter. While my experience at the company was 
                    great and I genuinely enjoyed the team and projects I worked on, I realized I enjoy the lower-levels of abstraction when it comes to computing after taking courses 
                    like Machine Organization, Embedded Systems, and Digital Design and Logic. 
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
                <p>
                    First of all, a huge shoutout to WFAA for taking me on board for an entire year, being so lenient with my schedule, and giving me so many opportunities to learn about 
                    the field of data science. Though I don't see myself working in that realm in the future, the technical and non-technical skills will definitely be applicaplbe to any work 
                    I do.
