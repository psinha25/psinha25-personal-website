                      My goal with future posts is to learn the art of storytelling and develop my own voice through my writing. The more

                <h3>Optum Background</h3>
                <p>
                  As the title states, I interned at <a href="https://www.optum.com/" style="color:#0078ff">Optum</a> during the the summer of 2019 (post freshman year) as a software engineering 
                  intern. This was my first internship and, honestly, I have no idea how I landed an internship at a premier healthcare 
                  technology company after only taking 2 computer science courses. I was very lucky and I am so grateful to Optum for 
                  taking a chance on me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case you haven't heard of Optum (I hadn't either before applying), it is the child company of <a href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/" style="color:#0078ff">United Health Group </a>
                  (UHG). Optum's headquarters is based in Minnetonka, MN, and they have multiple offices throughout Eden Prairie, MN.

                  Optum strives to better the health care system for all parties (i.e. pharmacies, providers, consumers, etc.) by using 
                  market-leading data, analytics, technology, and clinical insights. They have a plethora of products and services which 
                  are provided through their core business units - OptumInsight, OptumRX, and OptumHealth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my time at Optum, I was a part of <a href="https://www.optum.com/business.html" style="color:#0078ff">OptumInsight</a>. This business unit is where a majority of the technology folks are 
                  because the unit focuses on providing data, analytics, and technology to hospitals and consumers.

                <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                  When I began the internship, Optum software engineers were beginning to shift to open source technology. They were using projects from and posting their projects on 
                  Github in an attempt to embrace the open source software wave. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  While open source clearly has its advantages (promotes collaboration, grows your brand, increases efficiency of software engineers, etc.), it also comes with overhead. One 
                  aspect of GitHub that most people (including Optum engineers) overlook is complying with 
                  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository" style="color:#0078ff">GitHub licenses</a> 
                  and updating/managing dependencies. Given that Optum engineers were under a microscope being in the healthcare industry, it was imperative that they adhere to GitHub licenses and properly manage dependencies 
                  of repositories they were creating and/or using. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  To assist with both these issues, I was integrated into an existing software team to create an in-house application that managed dependencies and provided 
                  information about the GitHub licenses that the engineer must adhere to based on their repositories. This project was already under way and I joined midway 
                  through the project with two other interns - the team consisted of 4 developers and 3 interns (myself included) that summer. After I left, the application was made publically 
                  available and is maintained on GitHub. Check out <a href="https://github.com/Optum/barista" style="color:#0078ff">Barista</a>!
                </p>
                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>The summer was indirectly separated into two halves:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>Learn the fundamentals of web development and GitHub, familiarize myself with the existing code base, and extend the backend infrastructure for the application</li>
                  <li>Expand on the existing client-side code base by writing a few UI pages in Angular</li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Weeks 1-3</h6>
                <p>
                  During the first three weeks, my sole job was to learn. My manager was very direct with me and told me that given my background (only having taken 2 computer science classes), 
                  I had a lot to learn before I could provide meaningful value to the project. I came up with a game plan on WHAT and HOW to learn. The other two interns on my team 
                  (both rising juniors at the time) had more experience and gave me some direction (shoutout to Morgan and Matt). I ended up studying topics like:  
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Basic terminal commands</li>
                  <li>How the internet works</li>
                  <li>What is HTTPS</li>
                  <li>Basic architecture of web developement</li>
                  <li>Database basics - designing databases, PK, FK, relations, etc. </li>
                  <li>Web scraping - Python using BeautifulSoup</li>
                  <li> GitHub (obviously)</li>
                  <li>Angular</li>
                  <li>ExpressJS and Node</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  I learned these topics by watching Youtube videos (because I was scared of reading copious documentation) and creating some projects. 
                  For example, when learning web scraping I decided to web scrape statistics from basketball websites and format them such that they could be inserted into a database. 
                  I then designed a database schema (to the best of my ability with the limited knowledge that I had about database management systems), created an entity relationship 
                  diagram (ERD), and built the database in PostgreSQL. Then I was able to persist my web scraped data into database. Obviously this was a pretty small and silly project, 
                  but at the time it was a lot. More importantly, it allowed me to actually try and implement some of the knowledge I had learned. I had to use the terminal on my Mac, 
                  understand how to web scrape, implement a database, realize what a DOM (document object model) is for web scraping, and learn Python and SQL for the first time. 
                </p>
                <h6>Weeks 4-6</h6>
                <p>
                  These 3 weeks I focused on the backend infrastructure of the web application. Specifically, I ... 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Created a Python script to web scrape data from the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" style="color:#0078ff">National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD) such that the application can compare user's GitHub project dependencies 
                    to those in the NVD and output whether user's dependencies are vulnerable
                  </li>
                  <li>Extended the existing ERD to include more data as per specifications from my team</li>
                  <li>Wrote server side code (ExpressJS and Node) to process new requests that could be made from the client</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  All of the topics that I had learned about during my first 3 weeks were directly tied to the actual work on my project. The rest of my time at Optum was an iterative 
                  process of working on my team's project and learning on the fly. 
                </p>
                <h6>Weeks 7-10</h6>
                <p>
                  The final four weeks, I worked very closely with the lead developer on my team to build out the client-side code base. My team used 
                  <a href="https://angular.io/" style="color:#0078ff">Angular</a> to organize the code base. At the time, I had no idea what Angular was (or even what a framework for 
                  client-side code was). In fact, the concept was new to my intern teammates as well. We decided it would be best if we took a few days to learn together and potentially 
                  create a few UI pages ourselves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let me start by saying that working with others to learn a new topic can be fun AND annoying. We all had our different learning styles. I am someone who likes to take 
                  a more methodical approach to learning a new topic, whereas the two other interns preferred to begin writing code and learn on the fly. As such, we had to adapt. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we figured out how to work together to learn Angular, the entire process was actually a lot of fun. We took part in the Optum Hackathon that week and built an 
                  application using our new Angular skills to reinforce our understanding. From then on, we continued to build out UI pages for our team's web application and test our 
                  code consistently. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the very end of the summer, we gave a presentation to our team and some VPs on our work. I really enjoyed doing this. For some reason, 
                  I love giving presentations and talking, which is surprising given my introverted personality. 
                </p>
                <h3>Internship Reflection</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>
                    In all honesty, I really didn't provide much value to the team in terms of deliverables by the end of the summer. I bet you weren't expecting that üòÅ. In all 
                    seriousness, I wish I could've provided more value to my team. It wasn't because I was lazy and unfocused throughout the summer, but rather my lack of experience 
                    and understanding of basic fundamentals. I truly didn't have the knowledge to be able to provide value in the limited amount of time I had that summer. 
                    That being said, I know I took every opportunity to learn and grow that summer, which is something that I am very proud of. 
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    This leads to the biggest lesson of all that summer - HOW I learn best. I developed such a strong understanding of my style in learning efficiently. Being able to swim when 
                    thrown in the deep end is truly an acquired skill that can be developed, and I definitely had to learn it that summer to survive and provide as much value to my team. 
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Being integrated into a professional team, I picked up on the ins and outs of team dynamics. There are 3 specific lenses that I used to break it down:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      How do technical teams work? 
                    </li>
                    <p style="margin-left:2%;">
                      The main thing I learned was how a large application is broken into sub tasks that can then be tackled by different members of the group. Using tools like JIRA, 
                      GitHub issues, Kanban boards, and Slack were imperative for the work flow of my team. Code reviews were important to not just fix any bugs but also learn what are 
                      the best coding practices to prevent those bugs from occurring in the first place. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                      How does corporate America work? 
                    </li>
                    <p style="margin-left:2%;">
                      Like it or not, corporate America is one large game and if you want to make it up the chain, you can't just participate in the game, you have to actively play. I 
                      personally loved my time in the corporate setting, because I enjoy the human interaction, the politics, the "schmoozing" that is necessary to make good 
                      impressions. Whether it was asking questions during panels hosted for interns or simply learning about topics that I never new about because I wanted to have 
                      something in common with my manager, I saw all these interactions as a way for me to improve my soft skills. Now, I didn't change myself or stray away from my values 
                      when attempting to schmooze. I simply learned about things that are new to me and tried to hold conversations. I found this enjoyable and actually found new interests 
                      of mine by simply trying to personall connect with those "above" me.

                    <li>
                      Stripping away the job and professional setting, how do humans best interact with one another?
                    </li>
                    <p style="margin-left:2%;">
                      This was the toughest for me to understand, because everyone worked differently on my team. My manager often left me alone and wouldn't check in on me unless 
                      I asked for help. The interns on my team didn't enjoy pair programming.  Instead, we all worked on a task and then came together to discuss. For me, I wondered why I 
                      didn't have any strong opinions on how I work. When I think about it now, I really don't care as long as I get the job done. Obviously if there is a workflow that is 
                      established that truly hinders my ability to be productive, I speak up about it. But my attitude during my time at Optum was to adapt to others with the goal of getting 
                      a job done rather than focusing on myself. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left:2%;">
                      The other big lesson I learned was understanding when to let go. Working with a team, tensions can sometime run high when not seeing eye to eye. This was a situation 
                      that I ran into a couple times with the interns on my team. When we disagreed on which one of our ideas was the best for moving forward with a task, we often found 
                      ourselves not making any progress. Being the little freshmen of the group (the other two interns had just finished their sophomore year), I tried to stand my ground 
                      initially to prove my worth. But I quickly realized that "winning" these little disagreements meant absolutely nothing if we weren't finishing our tasks. So, I 
                      learned to let go (when appropriate) and go with the flow, literally. This not only improved team dynamics, but also taught me how to pick up on the queues that 
                      people give when they are starting to get a little too frustrated (including myself of course). Hopefully one day all these soft skills that I developed will come 
                      in handy üôÇ.

                <h3>Interning in Minnesota</h3>
                <p>
                  My parents immigrated from India to the United States in the 1990s and decided to live in Minnesota, so I'm a Minnesota native. It was really nice to come back home 
                  after my freshman year - I got to be with my family and hang out with all my friends and girlfriend. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                  For most Minnesotans, the commute to work can be a nightmare due to rush hour (just ask my mom, she drives 45 minutes on average to get to work). Fortunately for me, I 
                  worked at Optum headquarters which was literally a 4 minute drive from my parents house, regardless of traffic. As such, I never had to deal with rush hour which was a 
                  major blessing because I could sleep until 7:30 am and get to work by 8:00 am while still eating breakfast and showering in the mornings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, obviously perks aren't what makes an internship great (at least in my opinion, the project and experience you get is of utmost importance), but I won't deny that 
                  Optum has some amazing perks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In house coffee, sparkling water, and bubble tea</li>
                  <li>Great cafeteria - everyday day they catered food from somewhere (my favorite was Bay Leaf Indian Cuisine)</li>
                  <li>Amazing office and office view</li>
                  <li>Educational talks and panels with AI engineers to discuss the transition of technology in the healthcare industry</li>
                  <li>Intern events - Top Golf, Pinstripes Bowling, free food</li>
                  <li>Intern housing - I didn't need the housing but interns were offered a really nice apartment with a pool and all amenities paid for</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The interns I worked with made the entire summer worthwhile. Sure, we had our disagreements, but I really enjoyed getting to know them and hanging out with them everyday. 
                  Simple things like going to get Bundt Cakes in Eden Prairie or going out for lunch at Punch Pizza or "sneaking" up to the C suite floor to see what life is like at the top 
                  were a blast.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                  And finally, the team I worked for was amazing. My manager and all the other developers were extremely relaxed and understanding that this was a major learning experience 
                  for me. They taught me as much as they could and always answered my questions, regardless of how stupid they were. They took us out for lunch (my manager's boss loved 
                  Gogi Bros (Korean BBQ) right next to Optum and took us there twice) and really tried to get to know us. 
                </p>

                <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
                <p>
                  I can't stress enough how top notch of a company Optum is. The culture is absolutely amazing and they truly care about the healthcare industry and making it better for 
                  all parties. They take care of their employees and strive to make their time meaningful AND enjoyable. I grew so much more than I thought I would and it was a great first 
                  internship!
